This page documents the examples subdirectory. 

+ **01rcdefault** : This subdirectory contains a default resource file and an input file for PI 600K from Auhl _et al_

+ **02PIblend** : Input for PI 226k/23k blend from Read _et al_. Resource file asks for dielectric and G(t) in addition to G*(&omega;)

+ **03PS8** : Input for PS8 from Monfort _et al_ Rheol. Acta. 18, 623â€“628 (1979). The molar mass distribution is modelled as log-normal distribution with exponentially decaying high-molar mass tail. A separate code (supplied in the subdirectory) generates discrete weights and writes to a file. That file is called from the input file.
