This page documents the examples subdirectory.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{01rcdefault}} \+: This subdirectory contains a default resource file and an input file for PI 600K from Auhl {\itshape et al}
\item {\bfseries{02PIblend}} \+: Input for PI 226k/23k blend from Read {\itshape et al}. Resource file asks for dielectric and G(t) in addition to G$\ast$({$\omega$})
\item {\bfseries{03PS8}} \+: Input for PS8 from Monfort {\itshape et al} Rheol. Acta. 18, 623â€“628 (1979). The molar mass distribution is modelled as log-\/normal distribution with exponentially decaying high-\/molar mass tail. A separate code (supplied in the subdirectory) generates discrete weights and writes to a file. That file is called from the input file.
