v1.1
* R(t) beyond reptation time is handled analytically and involves complimentary error function.
  The series approximation performs poorly at very short times for very long polymers.
  Series approximation is replaced by in-built erfc function in GoftTube.cpp and in GenLinLogNormal.cpp
  Removed code for series approximation

* "time" in the exponential was missing in in-tube Rouse contribution in G(t)
   Corrected in GoftFast.cpp

* Change in  ReadRCFL.cpp: Correctly set STmaxDrop and Log_DtMult if no
    resource file were supplied. 
    (previously it required at least an empty resource file)
